Objectives of Apps are to: 

•	Automate the collection of data from STATIN, both new and revised data
•	Make it easier for persons to analyse economic industry/ies over different aggregation period (6-month), growth period, Contribution to Total Value Added in levels and growth, as well as a decomposition of each industry into Trend, Season and Remainder


Indicator:  

1.	"Value Added at Current Prices (Seasonally Unadjusted)"        
2.	"Value Added at Constant (2007) Prices (Seasonally Unadjusted)"
3.	"Value Added at Constant (2007) Prices (Seasonally Adjusted)"  
4.	"Value Added Deflator (Seasonally Unadjusted)" 

The indicators may be analysed over 4 periods
1.	"3-month"
2.	"6-month"  
3.	"9-month" 
4.	"12-month"

The growth rate is produced for the indicator and period of analysis over 4 periods:
1.	"3-month growth rate"
2.	"6-month growth rate"  
3.	"9-month growth rate" 
4.	"12-month growth rate"

Industry/ies to be analysed

Start and End Date, as well as selection of period ending for Mar, Jun, Sep and Dec.

The ability to view the graphs as Multiple Graphs (default option) or as a single graph.

Value – Box: Shows Period Analysed (End Date),
 Overall Performance (Total Value Added Growth Rate)
Top Performing  
Worst Performing Industry Industries based on End-Date Selected.

5 Plots and Tables are produced that looks on the selected industry/ies as it relates to:

1.	Levels
2.	Growth Rate
3.	Contribution to Total Value Added
4.	Contribution to Growth in Total Value Added
5.	Decomposition: Trend, Seasonality, Remainder
